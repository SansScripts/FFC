- **Target:** 2 elite WRs + 1 elite RB OR 2 RBs + 1 elite WR
- **Philosophy:** At pick 10, you're in perfect position for the WR/RB turn strategy

### Rounds 4-6: Core Depth (Picks 39, 58, 63)
- **Focus:** Fill remaining RB/WR needs, consider elite TE if available
- **Key:** This is your last chance for reliable weekly starters

### Rounds 7-9: Value & Upside (Picks 82, 87, 106)
- **Targets:** QB1, breakout candidates, handcuffs

## Draft Day Tips

### **DO's:**
1. **Stick to your board** - Don't panic if runs happen
2. **Stay flexible** - Adapt to draft flow, don't force positions
3. **Target volume** - In 0.5 PPR, targets and touches matter most
4. **Handcuff your top RBs** - Rounds 9-11 are perfect for this
5. **Take shots on upside** - Rounds 12-15 are for lottery tickets

### **DON'T's:**
1. **Don't reach for QBs** - Value exists in rounds 6-9
2. **Don't overdraft TEs** - Unless it's elite value (LaPorta/Andrews)
3. **Don't ignore rookies** - This class is special at WR
4. **Don't draft backup QBs early** - One QB is enough until round 12+
5. **Don't forget K/DST** - Your scoring rewards good defenses

## Championship Construction Notes

### **The Path to Victory:**

1. **Weeks 1-4:** Establish your core, identify waiver priorities
2. **Weeks 5-8:** Make aggressive trades to upgrade weak spots
3. **Weeks 9-12:** Secure playoff positioning, grab handcuffs
4. **Weeks 13-14:** Stream defenses, optimize matchups
5. **Playoffs (15-17):** Trust your studs, play matchups for flex

### **Waiver Wire Strategy:**
- **Budget:** If using FAAB, save 40% for mid-season breakouts
- **Priority Adds:** Week 1 breakout WRs, injury replacement RBs
- **Hold Period:** Give rookies 4 weeks before dropping
- **Streaming:** Begin streaming defenses week 8 if needed

### **Trade Strategy:**
- **Buy Low Windows:** Weeks 3-4 (panic sellers), Week 8 (bye week hell)
- **Sell High Windows:** After big games, before tough schedules
- **Package Deals:** Use depth to upgrade starters by week 8
- **Handcuff Trading:** Offer handcuffs to RB owners for upgrades

## Final Thoughts

Your draft position at 10th overall is actually advantageous in 2025. You'll have access to elite WRs and can build a balanced roster with the turn picks. The key is staying disciplined, not reaching for positions, and taking advantage of value when it falls.

Remember: Championships aren't won at the draft, but you can certainly lose them there. Stay active on waivers, make strategic trades, and trust the process.

**Good luck, and let's bring home that championship!**
